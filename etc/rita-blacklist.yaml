# Custom Blacklist files should be comma separated, with one line per desired
# blacklist entry. The first value should be the domain/host, the second value
# the ip. Only domain or ip is required, but if one is missing there should
# still be an empty place for it in the file. For example, if domain is missing
# the line should look like:
#  , 1.2.3.4
# and if ip is missing the line should look like:
# domain.com, 
# a dash (-) is also acceptable in place of the missing field.
# Any values beyond the first two values won't be entered into the database, but
# won't cause any issues with parsing. If a line begins with a '#' it will be
# considered a comment. but a '#' appearing later in a line will not comment out
# what comes after it.
# Location must be http, https, or an absolute file location, and is required.
# Name is optional. If left blank, it will be set to equal the location.
# ValTime is the number of days between updating that particular blacklist. It
#   is optional, and if left blank will be set to 36,500.

# Custom Blacklist: describes the sources of the custom blacklist files.
